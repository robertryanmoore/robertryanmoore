# ROBERT RYAN MOORE

## WHO I AM

I am a young programmer with a passion for learning and a determination to write good meaningful code that will make a difference in the workplace. I am open minded to learning and trying new techniques and technologies. Basically, I just want to build cool stuff. I have worked at 3 different companies on enterprise projects and done a little bit of freelance work developing desktop software. My experience is mostly in Java and C# though I have done some web automation and I consider myself language agnostic as I am willing to work with any language and am always grateful for the chance to pick up a new one.

That said,  I am 100% guilty of being one of those guys who creates repos for new ideas then never actually does anything with them, so if you poke arounf my profile you'll see a couple of empty repos.

## THIS REPO
I've used this repop for my [portfolio website](https://robertryanmoore.co.za/index.html). It's a fairly basic react site,  serverd through Nginx on an Oracle Cloud Ubuntu VM.
